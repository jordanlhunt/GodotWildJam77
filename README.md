Godot Wild Jam 77 - Theme: Metamorphosis

My first Game Jam of 2025. I hope to learn the basics of setting up projects and developing the very basics of workflow and doing game jams. My goal for this jam is to simply complete a project. I will likely try to recreate an existing game like Tetris or but I want to complete it in seven days.
